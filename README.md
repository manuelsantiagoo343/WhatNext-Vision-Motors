Project Overview

WhatNext Vision Motors revolutionizes customer experience and operational efficiency using the Skill Wallet platform.
The system streamlines vehicle ordering by automatically assigning orders to the nearest dealer based on the customer’s location and blocking orders for out-of-stock vehicles.
